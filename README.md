When you join the service you recieve the following SMS message: 


> Welcome to Cellcom TV! To activate your account please use the following username: **\<EMAIL-ADDRESS\>** and password: **\<AUTO-GENERATED-PASSWORD\>**.
> In case that the email address is incorrect, please responded to this message with a proper email address.

# The vulnerability

What i basically did is to send a SMS message with a spoofed number (my own number which associated with my account) and tried to change my own email-address.
Well, it worked. Which means that everyone can hijack other's people accounts.
